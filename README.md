# shouldendtheir.life

an unfunny domain only mentally ill people buy.

obviously this is only satire, don't take it seriously.

## where can i get my subdomain?

create an issue with this format

```md
**subdomain**: blah.shouldendtheir.life
**cname answer**: yournormal.website.github.pages.whatever
```

great documentation, i knwo.
this *is* subject to change cuz i might waste more money on subdomains.
