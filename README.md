Free subdomains for all.

## Get your Subdomain

To get your own subdomain. Open an issue with THIS format.

Anything that does NOT use the format below will be denied and closed.

```md
**subdomain**: blah.shouldendtheir.life
**cname answer**: yournormal.website.github.pages.whatever
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please make sure you have configured the domain CORRECTLY on your GitHub Pages settings. To do so, please "Add Custom Domain" to your repo in the Pages settings tab. After that, you can open the issue and request your website. The DNS record may take time to update, so please be patient before opening a new issue or contacting me for help.

## Donating

Obviously, free domains cost *me* money to host. If you really like this domain, you can donate to help me keep it alive (it costs $22/year and I have no way to make money during the school year, lol.), you can message me @i.fwd on Discord and we can discuss donations (anything between $0.50 and $5 would be HEAVILY appreciated. Donations aren't required obviously but it'd make my day (and life) easier if I got a little more money to keep this service up for free).

Thank you.
